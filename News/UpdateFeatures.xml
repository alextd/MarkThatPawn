		<content>Since the response of the mod was so positive I decided to expand on it further.
It is now possible to change the icon-set in the mod-options as well as have different icon-sets based on the pawn-type.
The icon-sets are now based on xml and it should be pretty simple to add more.
I added two new sets, one with simple numberings and also one with icons based on work-skills.
The latter is based on icons from the Pawn Badge mod, following its included License.
1.3 is now also supported but adding features to both versions is a bit of a pain so only the 1.4 version will see further additions.
If you have any ideas for additional marker-icons, please leave a comment on the mod-page or on the linked Discord server!</content>
