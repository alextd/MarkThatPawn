You get a large raid and looking through the pawns you find one that would be excellent to capture, but sadly you loose them in the action. You later find their corpse blown up by one of your rockets.

With this mod you can mark any pawn with a selection of icons to make them easier to keep track of.

There are mod options for the size of the icon as well as a possibility to make them pulse like the question mark over traders in a caravan.

Should you want to have you own icon-set you can do so the same way as normal re-texture mods.
You can even add more textures as the mod iterates over Marker_ image-files at game start.
